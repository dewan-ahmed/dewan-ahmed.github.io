[THIS IS IN DRAFT]

> It's just a video. How hard can it be?

As developer advocates, we make complex topics relatively simple for developers. Some developers learn better from text and some from video. However, building and promoting video content that developers love are way more nuanced than text contents.

Crafting top-notch video content isn't just about snagging the best gear or having a lively host. From livestreams to regular tutorials to short form videos, releasing quality videos takes a village. I've been studying how the best developer relations teams nail their video content, and that's what this guide's all about. I've compiled everything I could think of when it comes to ideating, building, releasing, and promoting video content for a developer audience. Here's the TL;DR of what I'll cover:

- Getting buy-in from execs
- Deciding on the right type of video
- ROI vs. efforts on different types of video
- Content reusability and measurement
- Bonus practical tips

## Setting the stage

Without a clear scope, most solution ends up with "It depends" response. So let me set the stage for an ideal audience of this field guide. Others can tune based on their situation. I'm assuming:

- YouTube is the default choice. If you use something else, like Vimeo, most of this guide should still be useful
- you are a DevRel team of five reporting to some VP who reports to the CEO
- you have a head of DevRel, three developer advocates (North America, Europe, Asia), and a community manager
- one of the developer advocate is pretty good at video editing and the team is multilingual
- you have limited but non-zero resource (people & money) to spend on video

The goal of this field guide is to equip you with sufficient information so that you can put that limited resource to good use and start producing decent level developer-focused video contents. For the rest of the blog, I'll be talking to you - the head of DevRel.

## Understanding the Stakeholders

You don't start the video content journey from a Miro board or OBS studio. **Exec buy-in** and being on the same page around priorities are the first steps.

> Do you understand how the video content investment ties directly to brand awareness and new developer sign ups?

> Do you understand that this will be an ongoing initiative and not a short-term one?

Ask these two questions, in order, to your DevRel team, the VP, and the CEO. If you don't have a positive response at any point, don't bother reading rest of the guide and work on getting on the same page around priorities.

You might think that execs don't care about video content. They have higher level goals assigned for the team and it's totally upto you on how you create a strategy around video. Not quite, my friend. You work at a startup and there's always more work than number of people doing those work. When you ask for some resource

## Phase 1: Align with organizational OKRs

- **Business Alignment:** Before outlining video topics or formats, understand your organization's overarching goals. Where does the DevRel team sit? Is the company launching a new product? Trying to tap into a new demographic? Is awareness the primary goal or is it establishing industry authority? Aim to have the DevRel video content support these larger objectives.

- **Product Releases:** Sync with the product teams. Knowing product release cycles and upcoming feature drops will let you schedule content timely, maximizing its relevance and impact. This ensures that your audience always has the latest information, positioning your brand as an authority.

- **Marketing Campaigns:** Stay updated with the marketing team's campaigns. If they're pushing a particular product or feature, align your video content to amplify their messaging. A coordinated front across marketing channels will increase message retention and brand recognition.

## Phase 2: Audience Analysis

I know your team can't wait to record those videos but as the head of DevRel, you should encourage the team to do an audience analysis first.

- **Where They Consume Content:** Not every developer is on every platform. Some might lean heavily on YouTube tutorials, while others are engrossed in Twitter threads. Conduct surveys or use analytics tools to determine where your audience spends their time and craft content strategies tailored to those platforms.

- **Popular Video Formats:** It's not just about the platform, but also the format. A developer on YouTube might prefer a detailed explainer video, while one on TikTok could be looking for quick tips or hacks.

- **Classify by Expertise:** Understand your audience’s expertise spectrum. Beginners might appreciate foundational content, walkthroughs, or "101" series that introduce them to basic concepts. Experts will get bored with getting started content and they look for deep dives, or advanced tutorials. I'll use Terraform (a popular infrastructure as code tool) as an example.

  - **Beginners:** Developers who are new to Terraform might feel lost looking at just the API docs under the public Terraform registry. They need detailed tutorial and getting started videos to be able to use your company's Terraform provider.

  - **Experts:** You might have a ton of resources on your company's documentation site on how to get started using your Terraform provider but expert users will start with the official Terraform registry documentation. They are not looking for getting started content. They might be looking at advanced configurations, importing resources, or connecting to a service behind a VPN.

Once you’ve segmented your audience, tailor the video content for each. A one-size-fits-all approach may not resonate, and remember: relevance is key. By understanding and aligning with both your internal stakeholders and your external audience, your DevRel video strategy becomes not just a content plan, but a mission-critical asset to the organization's broader goals.

## Phase 3:

As the head of DevRel, you want to understand the work it needs for each type of video content and the impact they would generate.

### a. Event talks (5mins - 60mins)

Whether your team delivers a 5mins lightning talk or a regular 30mins talk, practice a habit that if the talk is not recorded, the event didn't happen.

Cost and effort: These videos are the product of your developer advocates giving talks. Your team didn't incur additional cost for those videos. So the cost and effort for these videos are minimal.

Impact: You care about the 50 people who were in the room live, but you REALLY care about the 10K+ potential of replays in a year for this talk on YouTube. This is assuming the organizer did a decent job with the recording and editing and the talk was interesting :)

Promotion: Your DevRel and social media team can amplify these videos via your company channels.

Metrics: Oftentimes these video content are not within your company sites. They might be uploaded on some conference's YouTube channel. You can track the number of views, interactions, and any comment/question that shows on the video.

Bonus tips: Remember to send a UTM link to the organizer for any resource you reference in your talk so that they can add that in the talk description. This wil allow you to add one more level of tracking for this video content.

**Editing:**

- High-quality animations, on-screen text for important points, background music adjustments.

**Promotion:**

- Use SEO-rich titles, descriptions, and tags. Collaborate with tech bloggers to share content.

Livestreams (1.5+ hours)

**Purpose:**

- Foster direct engagement. Answer questions on-the-go. Dive deep into coding sessions or debugging.

**Editing:**

- Minimal post-session editing. Main focus: stream stability, audio clarity, and interactivity tools.

**Promotion:**

- Teasers on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn. Share highlights of previous streams.

### b. Long-form YouTube Webinars (45mins - 1 hour)

**Purpose:**

- In-depth exploration of tools, updates, or coding techniques.

**Editing:**

- Detailed segmentation. Consider pop-up texts for important points and professional transition effects.

**Promotion:**

- Newsletters, developer forums, and partner with influencer developers on YouTube.

### c.

### d. Short-form videos (30secs - 3mins)

**Purpose:**

- Instant tips, quick updates, or feature intros.

**Editing:**

- High-energy, quick transitions, and clear call-to-action.

**Promotion:**

- Ideal for Twitter, LinkedIn, and even Instagram reels.

## Phase 4: Start getting some videos out

This is the meat (or tofu) of the field guide.

## Testing

Now that you've recorded the videos, let's do some testing.

## Feedback Loop

Even the most meticulously crafted video content strategy requires consistent tuning and adjustments. A feedback loop ensures that you're always aligned with both your stakeholders' expectations and your audience's needs. Here’s how to cultivate a robust feedback mechanism:

### Internal Feedback Channels

- **Meetings with Stakeholders:** Regular sync-ups with key stakeholders like product managers, marketing teams, and sales personnel are essential. These meetings can provide insights into how your video content is aligning with business goals, product launches, and other key metrics. For instance, the sales team might have feedback from potential clients about a particular video that could be influencing purchase decisions.

- **Casual Chats:** Sometimes, the most valuable feedback doesn’t come in a formal setting. Engaging in casual chats with colleagues from various departments can yield golden nuggets of information. Maybe they've stumbled across an online discussion about your video, or they've got a friend in the developer community who had thoughts on your latest tutorial.

### Engaging with the Audience

- **AMAs (Ask Me Anything):** Hosting regular AMAs on platforms like Reddit or Discord can be invaluable. These sessions not only humanize your brand but also serve as a direct line to your audience's pulse. Developers might provide feedback on a particular video, suggest topics they're eager to learn about, or even express concerns that you can immediately address.

- **Feedback Surveys:** Post-AMA, consider sending out short feedback surveys to participants. These can delve deeper into specific aspects like video length, content depth, or even presentation style.

Gathering feedback is only the first step. It's crucial to then dissect this feedback, identify patterns or recurring issues, and pivot your strategy accordingly. Remember, at the heart of every successful DevRel video content strategy is an understanding of its audience and stakeholders, and a feedback loop ensures that this understanding remains sharp and updated.

## Housekeeping

- Turn off video comments
- Engage in ice-breaker chats during streams
- You might need to block people

## 4. Importance of Proper Video Editing

**Quality Control:**

- Use color grading to match company branding. Sound enhancements are critical.

**Animations:**

- Use animations to underline key points. However, avoid overusing to maintain authenticity.

**In-house Vs. Agency:**

- Initially, an in-house editor offers content control. As demands grow, specialized agencies can offer extensive expertise.

## 5. Repurposing Content

Repurpose livestreams into a series of shorter YouTube videos. Transcribe sessions to create blog content. Use engaging sections as TikTok videos or Instagram Reels.

## 6. Tracking & Measuring Success

Your video content should be outcome focused rather than output focused. Think in the line of 50 sign ups every month from video content rather than 5 videos published every month.

**Metrics:**

- Track engagement using YouTube Studio: view count, watch time, audience retention, and CTR (Click Through Rate).

**Feedback:**

- Monitor the comment section, run post-video surveys, and stay updated with community forums.

## 7. Video Content Segregation

**Product-based Playlists:**

- Dedicate playlists to each product, ensuring easier navigation.

**Event-based Playlists:**

- Segregate by webinars, How-Tos, etc.

## 8. Production Scale

**In-house Production:**

- Ideal for controlled, consistent content. Investment: Equipment & training.

**Agency Production:**

- For scaling needs. Leverage their specialized skills and tools.

## 9. Ensuring Professional Video Content

**Thumbnails:**

- Keep them consistent. Use high-quality images, with bold text overlays.

**Lighting/Audio:**

- Good lighting kits and microphones are investments, not costs. Poor audio/lighting can alienate viewers.

**Animations:**

- Subtle animations can break the monotony. Use sparingly.

**Funding:**

- Initially, use marketing funds. As ROI becomes evident, consider sponsorships or dedicated budgets.

## 10. Team & Resource Considerations

**In-house:**

- Begin with a versatile team. Offer regular training sessions, especially on trending topics or tools.

**Agency:**

- Collaborate with tech-focused agencies. Their expertise can be invaluable.

## 11. Equipment Strategy

**Essential Equipment for DevRel Video Content**

Crafting high-quality video content is not just about the content itself but also the tools used to create it. Investing in the right equipment can greatly enhance the quality and professionalism of your video content.

**Visuals:**

- **Webcam:** A clear, high-definition video is non-negotiable. Consider investing in reputable webcams like the **Logitech Brio** which offers 4K video quality, ensuring clarity and a professional look.

- **DSLR/Mirrorless Cameras:** For pre-recorded videos or high-quality streams, DSLR or mirrorless cameras offer superior video quality. Paired with a good lens, they can provide a depth of field making the subject stand out.

**Audio:**

- **Microphones:** Clear audio is crucial. Background noise or muffled voices can deter viewers. **Yeti microphones** are an industry favorite, offering crisp audio capture suitable for both livestreams and pre-recorded sessions.

- **Acoustic Panels:** For indoor recordings, consider soundproofing the room or using acoustic panels. They reduce echo and background noise.

**Accessories:**

- **Lighting:** Proper lighting can drastically enhance video quality. Invest in softboxes or ring lights to ensure consistent and flattering lighting.

- **Elgato Stream Deck:** While useful, especially for regular livestreamers, it might not be essential for every DevRel team. It's beneficial for switching between scenes or triggering certain actions during a livestream. However, allocate budget for this only if livestreaming is a primary content form and demands seamless transitions.

**Budget Allocation:**

Equipment buying should align with content strategy. Prioritize essential tools that directly impact video and audio quality. Auxiliary tools, while enhancing the production, should be considered based on frequency of use and available budget.

## Conclusion

With developers increasingly turning to videos for learning and updates, a well-defined strategy is imperative. This guide offers a roadmap tailored for SaaS companies aiming for robust developer relations via video content. Tailor, engage, and refine continuously.
