Recently, a student reached out to me and asked:

> Could you guide me in terms of how I can get started with contributing to open source projects?

I'm a strong believer of reusable contents and that's why I decided to write a blog post on this topic. If you're a student, newgrad or anyone who is looking to start/transition into the software industry; open source contribution will be a strong skillset on your resume.

## What is Open Source?

**Open Source** or Open Source Software (OSS) refers to software code that is publicly available, open to modification and can be distributed the code as they see fit (some exceptions might exist based on licenses).

Do not confuse open source with free software as the focus is not on pricing. Please read more [here](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.en.html#:~:text=Nearly%20all%20open%20source%20software,version%20and%20using%20it%20privately.). 

## Why YOU should start contributing to Open Source

Since the target audience of this blog is not enterprise clients, I'll focus on the benefits of open source contribution for jobseekers in the software industry. 

- **Gaining experience**: If you lack internship or job experience, open source contribution can be a great way to gain relevant experience. Remember: the hiring manager is not looking for employment experience **only**. A relevant open source involvement can be valued higher by a team who is using that open source software in their product.
- **Building new skills**: Most open source projects encourage and welcome first-time contributions. In my opinion, this is one of the best ways to work with and learn from the industry experts WITHOUT actually being on the same team.
- **Building confidence**: Open source contribution can help minimize imposter syndrome. Once you start contributing to an open source project regularly, that's a solid proof of your understanding in the underlying technology. For example, imagine that you contributed to [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/) project before joining a team that uses ArgoCD in it's product. You'll be able to ramp up much faster than others as you're familiar with the codebase, features and the community. Your existing open source contribution(s) will boost your confidence in the enterprise team.
