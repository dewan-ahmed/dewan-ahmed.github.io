Do you identify yourself as a developer advocate? 

Are you confident that your skills are being fully utilized in your current role? 

OR,

Do you ever feel like your work requires more skills than what you currently possess? 

Developer relations (DevRel, in short), both as a field and for those working within it, is currently facing a significant identity crisis. There is little to no standardization across various aspects of the role, from the type of work being done, to the required competencies, and even to the ideal career ladder. This blog presents a somber view of the identity crisis currently plaguing DevRel. I conclude the blog with one action item YOU can take before irreparable damage is done to the very essence of our field's identity.

## Forming the identity

December 9, 1968.

Douglas Engelbart took to the stage to perform what would become known as the ["Mother of All Demos"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJDv-zdhzMY). Little did the audience know that they were about to witness a demonstration that would forever change the course of computing history.

Engelbart's presentation was not just a showcase of his technological innovations, but it was also an invitation for developers to collaborate with him in advancing the field of human-computer interaction. Many credit Engelbart to first plant the seed of technology evangelist. However, [Guy Kawasaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Kawasaki) is more widely known to pioneer the role of technology evangelist as the first successful one, promoting the Apple Macintosh in the 1980s through his passionate speeches, demonstrations, and events.

Around 2012-13, companies like EngineYard, Twilio, SendGrid, and New Relic took DevRel to mainstream by investing heavily in their DevRel programs and reaching their developers from a community-first approach. Rather than traditional marketing materials, these companies had engineers presenting technical talks at meetups and conferences.

### Battling for an identity

When I started my first official DevRel role at IBM, the answer to "what do you do at IBM?" never ended in one line. I was tired to explain my role every time so I [wrote a blog to explain](https://medium.com/@dewanahmed/what-i-do-as-a-developer-advocate-at-ibm-da2252179f6). Long before I had the title, I was delivering talks, hosting meetups, and writing technical blogs on my own time. I was doing this out of joy and could never imagine that I could do this full-time (and get paid to do so). 

As a full-time software engineer doing "DevRel thing" on the side, I didn't have an identity crisis. I was just another software engineer who was active in writing and public speaking. As soon as I started to do DevRel full-time, I started to ask myself "how valuable and visible is my work?". Check out what [Rachel](https://twitter.com/rachelnabors) has to say about the value of tech writing:

This can be very much relatable to the perceived value of DevRel.

It's a [golden thread](https://twitter.com/rachelnabors/status/1647771654519676929?s=20) for anyone in DevRel. Please bookmark!

## Engineering? Marketing? Product? Office of CTO? 

> Oh no! Not "where should DevRel sit" question again ðŸ¤¬




From Rachel's thread, it seems  

So how did we arrive at this point?

Surprisinly enough... it's because DevRel became highly successful!

Seeing the massive success of DevRel programs at companies like Twilio and HashiCorp, other companies wanted to replicate. 

However, simply copying their models does not guarantee success. In fact, many tech companies that attempted to do so ended up failing in their DevRel programs. Without an insider knowledge, here's my calculated guess on the "why":

1. Lack of genuine commitment: DevRel programs require a genuine commitment to developers and their needs. This means investing in resources like documentation, support channels, and events, as well as taking the time to engage with the developer community. Many companies see DevRel as an afterthought or a checkbox item, rather than a core part of their business strategy.

2. Poor understanding of the developer mindset: Developers have a unique mindset and approach to problem-solving. They value tools that are easy to use, well-documented, and flexible. Companies that fail to understand this mindset may develop tools and resources that are too complex or too restrictive, which can turn developers off. Even the best DevRel team won't be able to shine poor product will

3. Lack of trust: Developers are a discerning audience, and they can quickly sniff out inauthenticity. Companies that lack trust with the developer community, perhaps because of a history of closed-source practices or a lack of transparency, may struggle to build meaningful relationships with developers. If you went above and beyond on a developer event and the CEO comes to you right after the event asking for ROI 

Insufficient resources: Building a strong DevRel program requires a significant investment of time, money, and personnel. Companies that try to cut corners or skimp on resources may find that their DevRel efforts fall short.

Poor execution: Even with the best intentions and resources, DevRel programs can fail if they are poorly executed. This might include a lack of follow-through on promises, inconsistent messaging, or an inability to respond to developer feedback in a timely manner.

### Have we forgotten how to be engineers?

Let's clarify what I mean by "engineers". I live in Canada so I'm aware that the term "engineer" has a special meaning at some places that is regulated by local engineering associations. However, my use of the term "engineer" refers to anyone who has professionaly built software and hence, (software) engineer. It has nothing to do with your path to becoming a software engineer. Whether you're a ComSci PhD or a bootcamp grad, you possess certain skillset that is common to expect from a majority of other software engineers. 

In the last 10 years, the identity of DevRel has become more convoluted. When I started at IBM in 2014, there were very few developer advocates in the industry. A developer advocate would be someone with decades (not years) of engineering experience who chose not to go the management or principal engineer route. They wanted to teach and share their experience.  

One of the common complaints DevRel folks have is that we don't get a seat at the table in terms of product development and roadmap. Your peers at product or engineering will likely respect product feedback coming from an engineer than from someone who has very little to do with coding in their day to day job.



### You aren't gatekeeping... are you?

Most developer advocates these days confuse "learning in public" with "teaching in public". Your audience regards you as a subject matter expert because your title still means something. Many developer advocates before you paved the way with their knowledge, experience, and teaching and we're still reaping the benefits. 

When I take a strong position on developer advocates needing to be highly technical, I usually get three types of questions/comments:

1. What about developer advocates who are more community focused?
2. Are you trying to gatekeep?
3. But.. I have empathy for developers. Isn't that enough?

Here's my response:

1. You're confusing developer advocates with community managers. Use the proper title and then you'll have the proper job description.
2. Not really but can you maintain quality of **anything** without gatekeeping? Even a pull request needs gatekeeping so why not DevRel? From a software engineer to a sales rep, there is clear and unified job description and expectations for every single role in tech industry; except DevRel! 
3. And you're assuming that the other person competing for the role who is technical doesn't have empathy? 



### The real cost of identity crisis

Here's a CEO asking if developer advocacy is a good idea or not.

![Worse than consultants](/assets/images/2023/is-devrel-bad-idea.png)

Here's a programmer with ~40K Twitter followers who does not trust developer advocates because this person feels that developer advocates are just pitch people for their employers instead of people really helping developers.

![Unfollow developer advocates](/assets/images/2023/unfollow-developer-advocates.png)

At the core of this confusion, there are two questions:

1. What is DevRel?
2. [Why are we paying them?](https://www.dewanahmed.com/why-paying-devrel/)

If we cannot have a unified answer to the first question, more and more people will question the effectiveness of DevRel. In weak economy, you need a strong justification to the second question to save your job.

### But... there is hope
