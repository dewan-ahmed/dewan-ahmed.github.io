Do you identify yourself as a developer advocate? 

Are you confident that your skills are being fully utilized in your current role? 

OR,

Do you ever feel like your work requires more skills than what you currently possess? 

Developer relations, both as a field and for those working within it, is currently facing a significant identity crisis. There is little to no standardization across various aspects of the role, from the type of work being done, to the required competencies, and even to the ideal career ladder. This blog presents a somber view of the identity crisis currently plaguing developer relations. It delves into how our actions may have contributed to irreparable damage to the very essence of our field's identity.

## Forming the identity

December 9, 1968.

Douglas Engelbart took to the stage to perform what would become known as the ["Mother of All Demos"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJDv-zdhzMY). Little did the audience know that they were about to witness a demonstration that would forever change the course of computing history.

Engelbart's presentation was not just a showcase of his technological innovations, but it was also an invitation for developers to collaborate with him in advancing the field of human-computer interaction. Many credit Engelbart to first plant the seed of developer relations. 

From the storytelling of Steve Jobs at Apple events or Armon Dadgar explaining how Terraform or Vault works on a whiteboard, the art of teaching developers about technology has been best performed by the best engineers of our times. 

Neither Jobs nor Dadgar had an evangelist or advocate title. Around 2012-13, companies like EngineYard, Twilio, SendGrid, and New Relic took DevRel to mainstream by investing heavily in their DevRel programs and reaching their developers from a community-first approach. Rather than traditional marketing materials, these companies had engineers presenting technical talks at meetups and conferences.

### The tragedy...

Fast-forward to 2023 and we're seeing posts like this:

The company has since apologized and removed the post due to backlash.

But it's an important reminder that how far-fetched the meaning of DevRel can be for some companies or individuals.

### Have we forgotten how to be engineers?

Let's clarify what I mean by "engineers". I live in Canada so I'm aware that the term "engineer" has a special meaning at some places that is regulated by local engineering associations. However, my use of the term "engineer" refers to anyone who has professionaly built software and hence, (software) engineer. It has nothing to do with your path to becoming a software engineer. Whether you're a ComSci PhD or a bootcamp grad, you possess certain skillset that is common to expect from a majority of other software engineers. 

In the last 10 years, the identity of DevRel has become more convoluted. When I started at IBM in 2014, there were very few developer advocates in the industry. A developer advocate would be someone with decades (not years) of engineering experience who chose not to go the management or principal engineer route. They wanted to teach and share their experience.  

One of the common complaints DevRel folks have is that we don't get a seat at the table in terms of product development and roadmap. Your peers at product or engineering will likely respect product feedback coming from an engineer than from someone who has very little to do with coding in their day to day job.

While I don't agree 100% with what [Jens](https://twitter.com/jensneuse_de) tweeted above, [being an engineer is a non-negotiable requirement](https://www.dewanahmed.com/why-paying-devrel/#developer-advocates-must-be-technical) to become a good developer advocate. 

### You aren't gatekeeping... are you?

Most developer advocates these days confuse "learning in public" with "teaching in public". Your audience regards you as a subject matter expert because your title still means something. Many developer advocates before you paved the way with their knowledge, experience, and teaching and we're still reaping the benefits. 

When I take a strong position on developer advocates needing to be highly technical, I usually get three types of questions/comments:

1. What about developer advocates who are more community focused?
2. Are you trying to gatekeep?
3. But.. I have empathy for developers. Isn't that enough?

Here's my response:

1. You're confusing developer advocates with community managers. Use the proper title and then you'll have the proper job description.
2. Not really but can you maintain quality of **anything** without gatekeeping? Even a pull request needs gatekeeping so why not DevRel? From a software engineer to a sales rep, there is clear and unified job description and expectations for every single role in tech industry; except DevRel! 
3. And you're assuming that the other person competing for the role who is technical doesn't have empathy? 



### The real cost of identity crisis

We're seeing a lot of [concerns](https://twitter.com/jensneuse_de/status/1644312468166983685) and confusions around DevRel:

At the core of this confusion, there are two questions:

1. What is DevRel?
2. [Why are we paying them?](https://www.dewanahmed.com/why-paying-devrel/)

If we cannot have a unified answer to the first question, more and more people will question the effectiveness of DevRel. In weak economy, you need a strong justification to the second question to save your job.

### But... there is hope
