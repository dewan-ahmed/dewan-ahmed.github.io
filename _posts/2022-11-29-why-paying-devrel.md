> I don’t have a technical background so I’m looking to apply for a project manager, product owner, or developer advocate type role.

I offer pro bono career coaching outside work hours so I interact with a lot of jobseekers on a regular basis. Over the last few months, I’ve been observing a troubling trend. Folks who are trying to transition into tech from a non-technical background have mentioned something like the above quote. I had a mixed reaction hearing this. On one end, I was super happy that more people know about developer advocacy and are interested in a career. However, on a more troubling end, I thought to myself "are these folks seriously thinking of developer advocacy as **an easy way in**"? Folks who are new to this industry might not know much about developer advocacy. It’ll be scary, however, if tech leadership also sees developer advocates as fluffs. In this blog, I will share my thoughts and provide reasoning to make three claims:

1. Developer advocacy is a technical role.
2. Developer advocacy is NOT an entry-level role.
3. Your developer advocates are worth every penny you invest in them. 

In the foreword of [Mary's book](https://www.persea-consulting.com/book), Jono Bacon wrote:

> Developer Relations ... is a remarkably nuanced, complex, and **context-specific** discipline.

I know I'm making three absolute claims without the comfort of "it depends" answer. That is because I'll set the context and boundary for each of my claims. Grab your favorite beverage, relax, and read on. This one doesn't come with a TL;DR.

## What is Developer Relations (DevRel) anyway?

Since some of my readers might not know about DevRel, this section introduces the terminology. Feel free to skip this section if you're familiar with the roles. 

There are many right ways and only one wrong way to understand the different components of DevRel. The only wrong way is being caught up with how different companies structure and view their developer relations teams. For example, [Developer Relations - The Book](https://devrelbook.substack.com/p/developer-advocacy-doesnt-equal-developer) breaks down DevRel into four functional areas: developer marketing, developer experience, developer education, and developer success. On the other hand, developer experience is a superset of developer relations according to [Lee Robinson at Vercel](https://leerob.io/blog/dx) or [Milen Dyankov at AxonIQ](https://milendyankov.com/blog/2022/02/from_devrel_to_developer_experience/). Developer relations can report to the Engineering org like Google, Marketing org like Red Hat, or stay as a separate organization like Microsoft. Developer advocacy, which is a subset of developer relations, can have internal advocacy as well as external advocacy at some companies. All this to say that the definition and structure of developer relations can vary a lot. 

However, in my opinion, the role and work of a developer advocate can be universally defined regardless of the company or the position in an org chart.   

## DevRel - for every developer, not for every company

Why do you think you need a developer relations team? Did you get a series A funding and one of the investors suggested you get one of those developer advocate thing? In this section, I'll give you an overview of developer relations and developer advocacy so that you can decide if your company (really) needs one. 



Before we get into the overview, it's important to discuss the differences: **developer relations**, **developer advocacy**, **developer experience**. 

## Developer advocates MUST be technical 

## Developer advocacy - NOT an entry-level role

## Cost of DevRel depends on how you value them
