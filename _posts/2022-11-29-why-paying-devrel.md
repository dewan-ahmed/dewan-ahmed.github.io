> I don’t have a technical background so I’m looking to apply for a project manager, product owner, or developer advocate type role.

I offer pro bono career coaching outside work hours so I interact with a lot of jobseekers on a regular basis. Over the last few months, I’ve been observing a troubling trend. Folks who are trying to transition into tech from a non-technical background have mentioned something like the above. I had a mixed reaction hearing this. On one end, I was super happy that more people know about developer advocacy and are interested in a career. However, on a more troubling end, I thought to myself "are these folks seriously thinking of developer advocacy as **an easy way in**"? Folks who are new to this industry might not know much about developer advocacy. It’ll be scary, however, if tech leadership also sees developer advocates as fluffs. In this blog, I will share my thoughts and provide reasoning to make three claims:

1. Developer advocacy is a technical role.
2. Developer advocacy is NOT an entry-level role.
3. Your developer advocates are worth every penny you invest in them. 

In the foreword of [Mary's book](https://www.persea-consulting.com/book), Jono Bacon wrote:

> Developer Relations ... is a remarkably nuanced, complex, and **context-specific** discipline.

I know I'm making three absolute claims without the comfort of "it depends" answer. That is because I'll set the context and boundary for each of my claims. Grab your favorite beverage, relax, and read on. This one doesn't come with a TL;DR.

## Who is a developer advocate?

Since some of my readers might not know about developer advocacy, this section introduces the terminology. Feel free to skip this section if you're familiar with the role. 

There are many right ways and only one wrong way to understand the different components of Developer Relations (DevRel). The only wrong way is being caught up with how different companies structure and view their DevRel teams. For example, [Developer Relations - The Book](https://devrelbook.substack.com/p/developer-advocacy-doesnt-equal-developer) breaks down DevRel into four functional areas: developer marketing, developer experience, developer education, and developer success. On the other hand, developer experience is a superset of developer relations according to [Lee Robinson at Vercel](https://leerob.io/blog/dx) or [Milen Dyankov at AxonIQ](https://milendyankov.com/blog/2022/02/from_devrel_to_developer_experience/). Developer relations can report to the Engineering org like Google, Marketing org like AWS, or stay as a separate organization like Microsoft. All this to say that the definition and structure of developer relations can vary a lot. 

However, in my opinion, the role and work of a developer advocate can be universally defined regardless of the company or the position in an org chart. **A developer advocate is an experienced engineer who acts as a trusted voice between the company and the community/customer. They write clean code, produce reusable and developer-friendly content, and possess a tremendous level of empathy for the community**. They can work as part of a developer relations team or as the solo developer advocate for their company. There are three important pieces in my definition of a developer advocate:

- Engineer (builder)
- Trusted voice and experience
- (Interface) between the company and the community/customer

In the following three sections, I will discuss the reasonings behind my definition.

## Developer advocates MUST be technical 

In Canada, the term "Engineer" is protected and reserved only to those licensed by a provincial or territorial engineering regulator. Let's use the term "builder" instead. A builder is someone who has experience building software systems. 

Developer advocates are storytellers. Oftentimes, these stories are their own experiences of solving critical technical challenges. Even when they're building a demo application, their previous experience as a builder helps them architect the application to follow the best practices. Most talks follow a question/answer period where the audience asks the developer advocate questions about the technology they talked about. Even if someone (without the technical foundation) manages to rehearse and deliver a technical talk, it'll be incredibly difficult for them to answer the deep technical questions from the audience.

If you think that not all developer advocates need to be technical and some folks might be more on the community side, you might be mixing community managers with developer advocates. Community managers are also part of a developer relations team and their work overlaps some of the work of developer advocates around community. If you've seen a developer advocate doing 100% community work without producing code or technical contents, they might using the wrong title for whatever reasons. I've seen a sales representative on LinkedIn using "Sales Rep / Developer Advocate" as their title. 

What do I mean by producing code or technical contents? In the current time and market, almost everyone at a tech company can talk technical. Even basic git and GitHub are considered as general skills. To find the bar of code and technical content, you have to go back to your audience - the developers. Developers have evolved to grow an uncanny ability to smell sales and marketing tactics. However, they constantly seek technical knowledge from blogs and (reluctantly) skims through developer documentations. Your developer audience is the litmus test for the code and contents your developer advocate creates. Your developer advocate should somehow make developers' lives easier from the advocacy and content creations.  

Why I am trying to be a gatekeeper though? I don't think anyone can/should be a gatekeeper in tech but my opinions in this blog are coming from a genuine concern that some folks might be devaluing the developer advocacy role. When I was interviewing for my first job switch after 8 years in 2020, I was privileged to get a ton of InMails for DevRel roles. Unfortunately, a good percentage of these roles were for blockchain/crypto/NFT companies. What's unfortunate about it? 

I respect all technologies and legal companies. Here is the **unfortunate** bit. Almost every single recruiter from these companies assured me that I don't need to know ANYTHING about blockchain or the underlying technology to join their companies. This is after I mentioned that I don't have a clue about blockchain. What was important for these companies then? A large social media following and an ability to create endless marketing contents. I don't follow that industry but I can make a guess that without the technical foundation, most of the blockchain/crypto/NFT DevRel hires were unsuccessful at building the **trust** of their communities. 

Do you have a favorite developer advocate? I follow and respect a number of developer advocates in the industry. Let's take a look at their background and try to deduce if a technical background is needed or not to become a successful developer advocate.

| Name  | Roles before DevRel  |
|---|---|
| [Kelsey Hightower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Hightower)  | Software Engineer, IT Consultant, SysAdmin  |
| [Angie Jones](https://twitter.com/techgirl1908)  | Java Champion, Software Engineer, Inventor {26 patents}  |
| [Matty Stratton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattstratton/)  | Lead Engineer, Software Architect, Technical Consultant  |
| [Lorna Jane](https://lornajane.net/)  | PHP Consultant, Principal Developer, Senior Web Developer  |
| [Sai Vennam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saivennam/)  | Software Engineer, Web Developer  |

I hope I was able to explain why developer advocacy is and will remain a highly technical role.    

## Developer advocacy - NOT an entry-level role

Before I transitioned into tech, I worked as an electrical engineer building renewable energy systems. Before that, I spent 10 years at engineering schools in two countries where my brain was hammered to learn new things by reading documentation (a.k.a books) and then I built systems (a.k.a lighting up an LED) using that knowledge. Even with all that technical experience, it would be impossible for me to start my tech career as a developer advocate. I knew a lot about circuits, diodes, and huge transformers but nothing about SQL or git, let alone cloud and Kubernetes. I started as an intern at IBM, worked my way as a Java developer, and then transitioned to technical consulting. After 4 years of experience as a developer and consultant, I was able to start my developer advocacy career. 

Your path can be very different. You can be a CS grad or a college dropout, a Physics PhD or a musician - but you need the experience of building software systems before trying to teach others on how to build software systems. Whether it's for two years or twenty years, legacy enterprise development or freelance open-source contributions, a developer advocate must have **done the thing** which they are hoping to teach others. Without the technical experience, how can you teach a bunch of techies? [Angie Jones writes](https://github.com/readme/guides/angie-jones-demystifying-developer-advocacy):

> Developer advocates have to build and maintain credibility with their engineering peers, understand their pain points, and foresee how given solutions would address their needs. Without engineering experience, this is hard to do. Not impossible, but definitely hard.

Does DevRel look glamorous from the outside? The travel, staying at nice hotels, and the "influence" on social media might give all the wrong signals to someone looking to break into tech. Maybe we should talk more about the invisible hard stuff in the job. When I'm in my hotel room, I'm practising in front of a mirror for my talk the next morning and not sipping on pina colada by the pool. I've spent countless nights at airports and on economy flights without much sleep. I've had layovers at airports without a proper restaurant and survided on granola bars and coke zero. The economy flights wearing N95 masks can be anything but glamorous.

Based on 2022 State of Developer Relations report, [Taylor wrote on Twitter](https://twitter.com/taylor_atx/status/1575218433632804864?s=20&t=WwyR42KTOQPJ4zWn4mqmrw) about her hypothesis on why companies with new DevRel programs are hiring inexperienced folks 

## Cost of DevRel depends on how you value them 

## DevRel - for every developer, not for every company

Why do you think you need a developer relations team? Did you get a series A funding and one of the investors suggested you get one of those developer advocate thing? In this section, I'll give you an overview of developer relations and developer advocacy so that you can decide if your company (really) needs one.
