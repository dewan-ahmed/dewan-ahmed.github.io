I offer pro bono career coaching and do free resume reviews outside work hours so I interact with a lot of jobseekers on a regular basis. Over the last few months, I’ve been observing a troubling trend. Folks who are trying to transition into tech from a non-technical background have mentioned something like this: "I don’t have a technical background so I’m looking to apply for a project manager, product owner, or a developer advocate type role." I had a mixed reaction hearing this. On one end, I was super happy that more people know about developer advocacy and are interested in a career. However, on a more troubling end, are these folks seriously thinking of developer advocacy as **an easy way in**?? Folks who are new to this industry might not know much about developer advocacy. It’ll be scary, however, if tech leadership also sees developer relations (DevRel) as fluffs (case in point DevRel layoffs as soon as the market gets tough). In this blog, I will share my thoughts and provide reasoning to make three claims:

1. Not every company needs a DevRel team.
2. Developer advocacy is NOT an entry-level role.
3. Your DevRel team is worth every penny you invest in them. 


## DevRel - for every developer, not for every company

Why do you think you need a developer relations team? Did you get a series A funding and one of the investors suggested you get one of those developer advocate thing? In this section, I'll give you an overview of developer relations and developer advocacy so that you can decide if your company (really) needs one.
