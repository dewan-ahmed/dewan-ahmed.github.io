If you've used [grep](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/grep.1.html) to search for text or patterns in files, you'll love [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) - a command-line utility tool written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). By default, `ripgrep` will respect gitignore rules and automatically skip hidden files/directories and binary files. `ripgrep` is grep on steroids. It's super fast for searching patterns within single files and huge directories of files. In this blog, I'll help you get started with using `ripgrep` and hope it'll help you become more productive on the command-line.  

## Installation and sample data

The first thing you'll do is install `ripgrep`. It has first class support on Windows, macOS and Linux. Choose one of many [installation options](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation) or you can [build it from source](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#building). Fortunately, the binary is not called `ripgrep`; it's `rg`.

I have generated some sample server data which I'll use to test drive `ripgrep`. Feel free to download [this public gist](https://gist.github.com/dewandemo/26797dfbc2d3839bfe29621015566e8e) to play along. Each `mock-server-dataX.json` file has 1000 random server data and `mock-server.conf` file has a sample PostgreSQL configuration data.

## Searching within a single file

```
rg port mock-server-data1.json
```

We're telling `ripgrep` to search for the pattern "port" within a single file. You should see a 1000-line output since every object in that JSON array contains the "port" field.

Let's try something specific:

```
rg 9778b33b-2c49-4340-a9b5-320339052ec0 mock-server-data1.json
```

When searching for a particular UUID within the file `mock-server-data1.json`, you should see only one row as a result. This is helpful. But does this UUID exist in other files?

## Recursive search

Since `ripgrep` searches recursively by default, you don't have to do anything special other than omitting the individual file name.

```
rg 9778b33b-2c49-4340-a9b5-320339052ec0
```

Since you didn't specify a file name, `ripgrep` will search the current directory and sub-directories for files that contain the UUID `9778b33b-2c49-4340-a9b5-320339052ec0`.

![Recursive search](/assets/images/ripgrep-recursive.png)

Not only `ripgrep` color-codes the search result, it also tells us the line number on the files where the pattern appears. Let's validate this finding:

```
vim +203 mock-server-data3.json
```

The above command opens `mock-server-data3.json` on line 203. Did you know this vim shortcut? `:set nu` will confirm that the UUID `9778b33b-2c49-4340-a9b5-320339052ec0` is shown on this line. 

## Pattern search

The test data has some errors. Some of the fields contain emails although there isn't a field for email. Let's use regex to find these anomalies:

```
rg -e "[a-zA-Z0-9_]+@[a-z]+.[a-z]+" .
```

The `-e` flag is the regex option and the above is a poorly built email regex. The output is as follows:

```
./mock-server-data2.json
104:   "password": "test@test.com"

./mock-server-data3.json
152:   "password": "test@test.com"
288:   "password": "info@info.ca"

./mock-server-data1.json
48:       "password":"test@test.com"
112:       "password":"test@test.com"
```

We can see that some of the password fields incorrectly contain emails. Theoretically, it's possible that someone might be using the email as the password. But considering that these are randomly generated server passwords, we'll treat these as errors.

## gitignore and hidden files

`ripgrep` won't show these file types `.rgignore`, `.gitignore`, and `.ignore`
in search results. Although you can disable all ignore-related fltering with the `--no-ignore` flag. `ripgrep` will also respect repository specific rules found in `$GIT_DIR/info/exclude`, as well as any global ignore rules in your `core.excludesFile`.

Let's test this out:

```
rg tcp_keepalives_count
```

The output:

```
mock-server.conf
84:#tcp_keepalives_count = 0		# TCP_KEEPCNT;
```

Let's add `mock-server.conf` file to `.gitignore`, `.ignore`, or `.rignore`. 

Now if you re-run the previous search, there wouldn't be any output since `ripgrep` is filtering the `mock-server.conf` file out of the search.

## Performance

To get the maximum performance, `ripgrep` runs in a multi-threaded way which means that the result shown will not be in the same order for the same search running multiple times. The way `ripgrep` sorts the output is based on whichever file gets searched first. You can pass the `--sort` flag to sort the output which will come at the cost of some performance.

The line number and color cording are not the main selling point (it's open-source so no one's selling you anything :wink:) for `ripgrep`. Its main feature is being extremely fast and the author [Andrew Gallant](https://blog.burntsushi.net/) wrote a [detailed blog](https://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/) on `ripgrep` benchmark.

I was inspired by Brodie Robertson and Jay LaCroix to use `ripgrep` so thank you both.If you've given `ripgrep` a try, please [let me know](https://twitter.com/DewanAhmed) how your experience was.
