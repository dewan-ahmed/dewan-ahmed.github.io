Hello! I’m Dewan Ahmed - a software engineer and open-source developer advocate at Red Hat. Before starting at Red Hat, I have worked at IBM for six years as a developer, QA lead, consultant and developer advocate. My focus has mostly been in the areas of cloud and devops.

Besides work, I offer career coaching to students, newgrads and professionals who are trying to transition to the software industry. This site serves my blog, where I share my technical experience, articles on career as well as some random thoughts. 

When I’m not working, I spend quality time with my wife and toddler 👨‍👩‍👦 and play 🎱.
